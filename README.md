If you are working on a design system with multiple Sketch libraries, you might need to have a clear inventory of all the exist components of each library. This tool helps your to extract the selected library's components directories, include: symbols, layer styles, text styles and color swatches.

It's simple to use with 3 steps: 

- Select how you want to display the directory: Tree/Path;
- Select a library;
- Select which component (symbols/layer styles/text styles/color swatches) to extract;
- The directory will be displayed in a new page
